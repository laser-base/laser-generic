LASER (Lightweight Agent Spatial modeling for ERadication) is a framework for building agent-based infectious disease models with an emphasis on spatial modeling and efficient computation at scale.

[`laser-generic`](https://github.com/laser-base/laser-generic) builds on top of [`laser-core`](https://github.com/laser-base/laser-core), offering a set of ready-to-use, generic disease model components (e.g., SI, SIS, SIR dynamics, births, deaths, vaccination).

## New model components

`laser-generic` adds additional modeling components to those developed for `laser-core`. They include:

### Infection & transmission

- ``Infection()`` / ``Infection_SIS()`` – intrahost progression for SI and SIS models.
- ``Susceptibility()`` – manages agent susceptibility.
- ``Exposure()`` – models exposed (latent) state with timers.
- ``Transmission()`` / ``TransmissionSIR()`` – interhost transmission dynamics.
- ``Infect_Agents_In_Patch()`` / ``Infect_Random_Agents()`` – stochastic infection events.

### Births & demographics

- ``Births()`` – demographic process, assigning DOB and node IDs.
- ``Births_ConstantPop()`` – keeps population constant by matching births to deaths.
- ``Births_ConstantPop_VariableBirthRate()`` – constant population but with variable crude birth rates.

### Immunization

- ``ImmunizationCampaign()`` – age-targeted, periodic campaigns.
- ``RoutineImmunization()`` – ongoing routine immunization at target ages.
- ``immunize_in_age_window()`` – helper to immunize within an age band.

### Initialization & seeding

- ``seed_infections_in_patch()`` / ``seed_infections_randomly()`` / ``seed_infections_randomly_SI()`` – seed infections at start.
- ``set_initial_susceptibility_in_patch()`` / ``set_initial_susceptibility_randomly()`` – initialize susceptibility.

### Utilities

- ``calc_capacity()`` – computes population capacity given births and ticks.
- ``calc_distances()`` – helper for spatial coupling via geocoordinates.
- ``get_default_parameters()`` – returns baseline parameters.


## Installation

We recommend using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for faster, more reliable installs:

```
uv pip install laser-generic
```

Alternatively, you can use regular `pip`:

```
pip install laser-generic
```

To install the latest in-development version:

```
pip install https://github.com/InstituteforDiseaseModeling/laser-generic/archive/main.zip
```

## Documentation

https://laser-base.github.io/laser-generic/

## Development

To run all the tests run:

```sh
tox
```

Note, to combine the coverage data from all the tox environments run:

**Windows:**
```sh
set PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--cov-append
 tox
```

**Other:**
```sh
PYTEST_ADDOPTS=--cov-append tox
```
