# LASER documentation

LASER (Light Agent Spatial modeling for ERadication) is a high-performance, agent-based simulation framework for modeling the spread of infectious diseases. It supports spatial structure, age demographics, and modular disease logic using Python-based components.

The LASER framework is designed to be flexible and is composed of modular components that can be used to create custom epidemiological models. For those who want to explore disease dynamics without the need to code from scratch, the framework includes epidemiological components that are designed model diseases with non-vector transmission dynamics. These modules can be used to create anything from simple compartmental models to more complex agent-based models with spatial dynamics. The framework is open-source, so for those who want to [contribute to code](contribute.md), contributions are welcome!

## Installation

LASER is distributed as a Python package. The **recommended install path for most users** is through the high-level `laser-generic` package, which includes the core engine and all epidemiological modeling tools.

---

### ✅ Recommended for most users

To install LASER, run:

```
uv pip install laser-generic
```

This installs:

- `laser-generic`: modeling framework and components (e.g., SIR, SEIR, demography, mobility)
- `laser-core`: the basic data structures used by `laser-generic`

Once installed, you can start using LASER (importing components and composing a model) with:

```python
from laser.generic.model import Model
from laser.generic.models.components import Susceptible
etc.
```

---

### 🛠️ For engine developers

If you are developing or modifying the model code, you can install the low-level engine directly:

```
uv pip install laser-core
```

This is **not required** for modelers using the LASER framework via `laser-generic`.

---

### Verify the install

Check your install with:

```bash
python -c "import laser.generic; print('LASER is ready.')"
```

---

### Why `uv`?

[`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation) is a modern Python package manager that is:

- Much faster than pip
- Fully compatible with `pip install`
- Drop-in replacement for Python environments

To install `uv`:

```
pip install uv
```

<!-- [Don't write out personas or split tasks into persona groups; the docs should be task-oriented, so users can determine what they need by what tasks they're trying to accomplish. Understanding personas is an internal tool so we can appropriately identify tasks & necessary info]


As a reminder, the following tasks were listed in the original intro:

- Run powerful simulations of disease dynamics without building models from scratch. [Running sims]
- Leverage built-in examples for SIR, vital dynamics, spatial modeling, and calibration. [Code snippets in demographics, calibration; how-to in running sims, adding spatial dynamics, and tutorials]
- Gain insights into how spatial spread, birth/death, or vaccination influence transmission. [Tutorials]
- Run calibrations against real-world data to optimize model parameters. [Calibration]
- Compose custom models by integrating or modifying modular components, such as transmission, immunity, and migration. [getting started/running sims/custom models]
- Add epidemiologically relevant features like contact tracing or waning immunity. [Running sims]
- Run calibrations against real-world data to optimize model parameters. [calibration]
- Extend the LASER framework with new core functionality: algorithms, optimization backends, spatial logic. [development]
- Contribute performance-critical modules using Numba, OpenMP, or C. [development]

SO: the docs are going to need to have instructions and help on how to do all of these. I've added notes on where the info should go. As mentioned, don't split these up into persona buckets, just make sure the tasks are explained in order of start - finish (building up complexity).

We can change what the buttons link to, these are sort of placeholders right now.-->
